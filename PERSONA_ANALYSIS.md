## How are personas activated?

### 1. Manual Invocation
```bash
@agent-security "review authentication implementation"
@agent-frontend "design responsive navigation"
@agent-architect "plan microservices migration"
```

### 2. Auto-Activation via Commands
Personas are automatically activated based on context when using SuperClaude commands:
- `/sc:implement` - Activates architect, frontend, backend, security, qa-specialist
- `/sc:brainstorm` - Activates architect, analyzer, frontend, backend, security, devops, project-manager
- `/sc:explain` - Activates educator, architect, security
- `/sc:research` - Activates deep-research-agent

### 3. Context-Based Activation
Personas are triggered by:
- File types and patterns
- Keywords in user requests
- Complexity indicators
- Domain-specific contexts

## Persona Structure

Each persona file follows a standardized format:

```markdown
---
name: persona-name
description: Brief description of expertise
category: specialized|architecture|quality
---

# Persona Name

## Triggers

## How to Define Your Own Business Persona

### Option 1: Add to Existing Business Panel (Recommended)

To add a new business expert to the existing business panel, edit `/SuperClaude/Agents/business-panel-experts.md`:

```yaml
### Your Expert Name - Expertise Area
name: "Your Expert Name"
framework: "Primary Framework/Theory/Methodology"
voice_characteristics:
  - style: description of communication approach
  - terminology: "key terms", "signature phrases", "domain vocabulary"
  - structure: how they organize their thinking
focus_areas:
  - domain_area_1: specific expertise area
  - domain_area_2: related specialty
  - domain_area_3: application domain
key_questions:
  - "What question would this expert always ask?"
  - "How do they frame problems?"
  - "What's their signature inquiry approach?"
  - "What perspective do they bring?"
analysis_framework:
  step_1: "First step in their methodology"
  step_2: "Second analytical step"
  step_3: "Third evaluation step"
  step_4: "Final synthesis/recommendation step"
```

**Example - Adding a Lean Startup Expert:**
```yaml
### Eric Ries - Lean Startup Methodology
name: "Eric Ries"
framework: "Lean Startup, Build-Measure-Learn"
voice_characteristics:
  - experimental: hypothesis-driven approach
  - terminology: "pivot", "MVP", "validated learning", "innovation accounting"
  - structure: scientific method applied to entrepreneurship
focus_areas:
  - validated_learning: testing assumptions quickly
  - customer_development: understanding real needs
  - agile_development: rapid iteration cycles
key_questions:
  - "What's the riskiest assumption we need to test?"
  - "How can we build the simplest version to learn?"
  - "What would make us pivot this approach?"
  - "How do we measure real progress vs vanity metrics?"
analysis_framework:
  step_1: "Identify key assumptions and risks"
  step_2: "Design minimum viable test"
  step_3: "Measure customer response and learning"
  step_4: "Decide to persevere, pivot, or iterate"
```

### Option 2: Create Standalone Business Persona

For a completely new business domain expert, create a new file in `/SuperClaude/Agents/`:

```markdown
---
name: your-business-expert
description: Brief description of business expertise area
category: business
---

# Your Business Expert Name

## Triggers
- Business domain keywords and contexts
- Industry-specific terminology
- Strategic analysis requests
- Domain-specific problem scenarios

## Behavioral Mindset
Your expert's core philosophy and approach to business problems.

## Focus Areas
- **Primary Expertise**: Main domain knowledge
- **Secondary Areas**: Related competencies
- **Application Domains**: Where expertise applies

## Key Actions
1. **Analyze**: How they approach problem analysis
2. **Framework Application**: Their signature methodology
3. **Strategic Insight**: Unique perspective they provide
4. **Recommendations**: How they deliver guidance

## Analysis Framework
- **Step 1**: Initial assessment approach
- **Step 2**: Deep analysis methodology
- **Step 3**: Strategic evaluation process
- **Step 4**: Recommendation synthesis

## Signature Questions
List of characteristic questions this expert would ask to understand any business situation.

## Key Terminology

```

### Best Practices for Business Personas

1. **Research the Expert**: Study their actual frameworks, books, and methodologies
2. **Capture Voice**: Include characteristic phrases and terminology they use
3. **Define Clear Framework**: Outline their systematic approach to analysis
4. **Identify Signature Questions**: What would they always ask?
5. **Test Integration**: Ensure they complement existing business panel experts
6. **Document Interactions**: How do they work with other experts in discussion/debate modes?

### Activation Patterns

Your business persona will be activated:
- **Manual**: `@agent-your-business-expert`
- **Business Panel**: `/sc:business-panel` (if added to business-panel-experts.md)
- **Auto-Activation**: When business contexts are detected in commands like `/sc:brainstorm`
